# CFCMelanogaster

How do females make choices about which sperm will fertilize their eggs? In this study, we assess four geographically diverse <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> lines to show that females strongly prefer long spermâ€”a pattern consistent with female preference for high-fitness males. In addition, we perfumed males to show that females can adjust this general preference based on other factors, including pheromones. Because this adjustment occurs between genotypically identical males, it is entirely female-mediated.

## Data

Our behavioral and  morphological data are composed of 10 data files. 'Courtship.csv' and 'paternity.csv' contain our raw mating and paternity data. This mating data was restructured for our remating analysis in the 'remating.csv' file. Morphology data are summarized in 'morphology.csv'. Some morphology data was restructured for making figures, including 'SR_testis_length.csv' (seminal receptacle length, testis length, sperm length), 'area.csv' (spermatheca area), 'mass.csv' (female and male reproductive tract mass), and 'thorax_length.csv' (female and male thorax lengths). CHC data are included as 'CHC.csv'. Finally, averages for each <i>D. melanogaster</i> line are included in 'means.csv'. See 'metadata.xlsx' for the metadata of each file.

## Scripts

Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.3.1. Code for all figures and statistical analyses are included in 'CFC_mel_analysis.R' in chronological order by figure.
